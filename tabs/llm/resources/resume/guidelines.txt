I am going to give you two prompts.
The first is this, guidelines and a detailed resume.
The second will be one or more job descriptions separated by ***
For each job description, I need you to revise my resume to emphasize skills and experiences relevant to the job description.

Guidelines:

1.  Rewrite existing resume bullet points to align with the skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description below.
2.  Prioritize and highlight bullet points that demonstrate experience directly related to Software Development.
3.  Incorporate keywords from the job description naturally within the revised bullet points.
4. Adjust the wording of my resume to use similar wording and terminology to the job description provided.
5. The output should be a re-written version of my resume using the same section headers (e.g., 'Experience', 'Skills', 'Education') as the original resume.

Do not provide a summary of the job description.
Do not create entirely new bullet points; focus on modifying existing ones.
Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks; only output the revised resume.

Here is my resume:
