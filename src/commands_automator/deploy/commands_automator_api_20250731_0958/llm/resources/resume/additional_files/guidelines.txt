Here is my resume,
I need you to revise my resume to emphasize skills and experiences relevant to the job description.

Guidelines:
1. Rewrite existing resume bullet points to align with the skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description below.
2. Prioritize and highlight bullet points that demonstrate experience directly related to Software Development.
3. Incorporate keywords from the job description naturally within the revised bullet points.
4. Adjust the wording of my resume to use similar wording and terminology to the job description provided.
5. The output should be a re-written version of my resume using the same section headers (e.g., 'About me', 'Experience',', 'Education') as the original resume.
6. Wherever possible, add metrics.
7. Only mention cygwin if the job description specfically mentions linux exprience is needed.

Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks; only output the revised resume.
