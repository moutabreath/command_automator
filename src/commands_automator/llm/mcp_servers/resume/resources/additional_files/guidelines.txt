I am going to give you my resume and a job description.
First, extract the company name from the job description.
Guidelines regarding how to extract the company name:
  - (prefer the end-client over an agency). Normalize by:
  - Removing common trailing legal suffixes only (e.g., Inc., Corp., Corporation, Co., LLC, LLP, Ltd., Limited, GmbH, AG, SA, NV, BV, PLC, Pty Ltd., SAS, SRL, S.p.A., AB, Oy, K.K.) if present at the end.
  - Trimming surrounding spaces and collapsing internal whitespace to single spaces; preserve internal punctuation such as hyphens, ampersands, and apostrophes.
  - Converting spaces to single underscores after normalization.
  - Preserving capitalization of the brand name.
  - Prefix the resume with: ***applicant_name***_<Company_Name>
If a hiring company cannot be confidently determined, omit the company suffix and output just: ***applicant_name***

Next, revise my resume according to the job description.

Guidelines regarding the content of the resume:
- Rewrite existing resume bullet points to align with the skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description below.
- Prioritize and highlight bullet points that demonstrate experience directly related to Software Development.
- Incorporate keywords from the job description naturally within the revised bullet points.
- Adjust the wording of my resume to use similar wording and terminology to the job description provided.
- The output should be a rewritten version of my resume using the same section headers (e.g., 'About me', 'Experience', 'Education') as the original resume.
- Wherever possible, add metrics, but do not fabricate metrics; include only numbers explicitly provided in the resume or job materials. If none are available, keep statements qualitative.
- Only mention Cygwin if the job description explicitly requires Linux/UNIX experience—and only if such experience exists in the original resume.
