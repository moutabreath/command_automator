I am going to give you a short introduction of me, and then my resume and a job description. 
Adjust my introduction so that it would best match the job description.
The intent of this introduction is what I am going to tell the recruiter on the phone.
I'm a software engineer with 12+ years of experience.
I've worked across varied technologies and environments; my core experience is in C#, Java, and Python.
I've also held full-stack roles.
Until recently I worked at Applied Materials.
In Israel, the company manufactures chip-validation systems.
These systems integrate the required hardware and software, including the chip under test.
The product includes a Java legacy stack and a modern Java Spring Boot service layer with React and Python components.
I served as a senior software developer and led multiple projects, receiving recognition for one of them.
Leadership included initial conversations with product managers to refine requirements and align them with product and platform constraints.
I then produced designs and led development through the sprints to successful delivery.
I also built a Python tool to accelerate DevOps workflows by copying only relevant artifacts when safe, reducing turnaround from ~1.5 hours to seconds.
Additionally, I integrated Plotly Dash (Python) into the product.Next I am going to give you my resume
